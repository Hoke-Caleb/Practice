        <h1>Caleb Hoke's Portfolio</h1>
        <p>In this website, you will be given access to work created during my time in the University
        of Missouri Learning Design and Development graduate program.The site will cover the core 
        competencies learned throughout the program and include examples from both my classes and 
        the items I created for use in my classroom at Hazelwood East High School.</br>
        </br>
        My graduate program began in August of 2017. During my study I began with two goals: master
        the principles and nuances of the instructional design field and learn to code for website
        development. My time at the University of Missouri has helped me to achieve both of these goals. 
        I was also able to further my own knowledge of research and the process of evaluation. </br>
        </br>
        This website is the culmination of these skills. It will provide an overview of what I have achieved
        during my time in the program and also show the talents of those who have helped me along the
        way. I have been able to work with numerous talented individuals during this time and would like
        to thank them for helping me achieve my goals.
